The day to day life in the north does have it's
     problems; if you happen to own a car for which there is no
     local dealer, you may have to order parts from hundreds of
     miles away and have them shipped in by bus or plane.
     Meanwhile the car sits. The same applies to appliances,
     tools, and so on.
          There may not be a TV repairman in town. You must send
     the set out for repairs, or, buy a new one. By mail order of
