If the wildlife in the northern bush land seems
     different than found elsewhere, so is the life of man. It
     takes a special breed of person to live in the north. The
     farther one travels, the more this becomes apparent. The
     Southerner, whether on his first or fiftieth trip north of
     53, never really becomes aware of the implications of
     northern living.
          Generally, the owners of "cottages" on southern lakes
     have more amenities at hand for a weekend of "roughing it"
     than most northern dwellers have on a year round basis.
          The modern cabin on a lake shore near a large
     metropolitan center is equipped with electric service, a
     telephone, paved roads, natural gas pipelines, and cable
     television.
          Nearby are services that provide food, fuel, repairs,
     and entertainment. Drivein theaters and fast food chains
     abound. Waterfront businesses have docks built for those
     arriving by boat to do their shopping, laundry, or to
     transfer suitcases from the family car. The local merchants
     deliver goods to the cabin by road or by water.
     Entrepreneurs make a businesss of servicing and maintaining
     cabins during the owners absence in the off seasons.
          Most of these "cottages", whether on the lake shore, or
     located five well paved streets from the water, rival the
     homes of many city dwellers. These lake side communities,
     although seasonal, differ little from the urban living from
     which they offer escape.
